        <h1 class="custom-font">How does a stream of unsolicited referrals sound to you?</h1>
        <p class="custom-p-font">Good, right?</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">You still need to close the deals but referred prospects contacting you are usually your best leads. To generate the quality of leads you can expect from referrals is expensive. You either need a large number of leads which you are going to churn through or a terrific qualifying funnel that filters out low quality leads and leaves you with the ones ready to buy.</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">How do you get referrals?</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">There are many contributing factors. You are going to need to offer excellent products and services that people are happy to refer. You might want to provide exceptional service or even a memorable service to elevate you from the level of your competitors.</p>
