        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>EXELA offers a Lead Generation service to a small number of clients. We work as a Pay-per-lead service. We cover all the costs of developing the creative and the direct advertising costs, while you only pay for the leads we send you.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>Before we get started, we’ll agree together on what constitutes a qualified lead so you don’t have to worry about us sending you useless data and pretending that it could result in sales.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>Each week, we’ll send you a spreadsheet containing the leads generated for you, and you’ll simply pay for the leads that come through – we’ll agree the amount of leads you want, so there’s no chance of you overspending.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>As you’ll understand, this only works for us when we’re working with businesses keen to generate lots of leads, so we only work with clients willing to contract to buy a minimum number of leads per week for a minimum of six months.</p>

        <h1>Lead Nurture – Getting Those Leads Ready To Buy</h1>

        <p>Once a lead has been generated you need somewhere to put it and a way to look after it.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>We provide our clients with an Infusionsoft™ application, as we believe it is the best-in-class product. This allows sophisticated follow up, high quality nurturing and effective sales campaigns to take place.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>Marketing is all well and good, but ultimately it generally only creates opportunity, and the sales process is vital in turning that opportunity into money.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>We’ve got two options for organisations who want to make that process as smooth, slick and automates as possible, and the option that’s best for you very much depends on where you’re at.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>If you’re already using Infusionsoft™, then the ‘Opportunity Manager’ functionality will allow your sales team to prioritise leads, organise communication with them and close more sales.</p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p>However, if you’re not an Infusionsoft™ user, and you don’t require any marketing automation, then Pipedrive is the ideal sales tool for you and your sales team, allowing you to manage leads and opportunities and convert both into sales</p>
