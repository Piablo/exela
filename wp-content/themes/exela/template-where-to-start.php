        <h1 class="custom-font">Business: Where to Start and Best Practice for Getting it Right</h1>
        <p class="custom-p-font">It's not easy setting up a new business. Where to start is often a bone of contention, as there are so many theories and philosophies about marketing, digital mar-keting, sales and business development. What seems to be most needed out there is a trustworthy guide.</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">So we've prepared a checklist of steps to take in a logical sequence for marketing communications processes and sales processes in business. Working with your EXELA coach, you should check off each step, racking up your confidence that you are covering all the pieces of the process. We zoom in on what accelerates implementation and delivers benefits fast.</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">Each piece can and should be worked on and implemented independently. The process will come to-gether, like building blocks. It is not feasible to construct every block before going live. That will slow the benefits down unnecessarily.</p>

    <h1 class="custom-font white-text align-center">The Business Of Tools For Starters</h1>
    <p class="custom-p-font white-text align-center">The software tools we use at EXELA contain a workflow engine, campaign builder, the features and functionality that support the operations within many companies. We use Infusionsoftim to support the activities of our service business. However, that's not to say that one size fits all. As what to do to help your activities is specific to your business, it is a conversation to have with your EXELA coach.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font white-text align-center">It is worth stating up front that Keap(4' and Infusionsoft'm are software tools, good ones, but just tools, nonetheless. EXELA also uses other tools, that interact or extend their core CRM capability, but again, these are also only tools. The approach we take is one of logical business sense. Best practice is never driven by funky software features or new digital marketing hacks.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font white-text align-center">So, does that mean that the marketing and sales process are the same in every business? Essentially yes. Sure, there will be nuances and content will be specific to each business, but in general, the steps and building blocks are standard to all.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font white-text align-center"> Built into the approach is the philosophy that one should move fast and optimise later. Rather than agonise over a detail, get something live and come back once you can see the performance. Avoid getting trapped in intellectual debates. Let real numbers guide you. "Good is good enough."</p>

<div class="container-2-block-1-exela">
    <h1 class="custom-font dark-grey-text align-center">Where to Start in the Business of Smart Client Management</h1>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">Before we get into detail, it is helpful to understand the overview and why having a plan of action is desirable. When I ask my customers "what they want", from a sales and marketing perspective, they often answer - "more leads."</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">Very understandable. More leads = more business, right?</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">However, many businesses work in a wasteful way. They execute marketing initiatives, usually costing money, to generate leads. They follow up with some of those leads, get into sales conversations, and close some deals. But they rarely even make meaningful contact with most of the leads. For example, a business might generate one hundred leads, only contact ten of the prospects and win two deals. That's a lousy 2% conversion. What happened to the ninety leads with whom you did not connect and the other eight deals that did not close? This process is very inefficient.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center dark-grey-text bold">Most business only market to less than 5% of prospective customers.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">Businesses only tend to market what they sell. Very sensible. People actively looking to buy will spot the product and begin the buying cycle. However, that leaves 95% of the target market who are not actively looking to buy right now.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">This 95% will still have problems and pains. With some thought and creativity, you might be able to come up with a "lead magnet" that these prospects are at-tracted to and happy to trade for their name and email address. Once you have the contact details of someone who is the right target market and does have a problem, we can market to them, adding value as we go, until they are ready to buy.</p>
    <p class="custom-p-font align-center">If your system is sending the communication, and tracking response, you can make them the right offer at the right time. </p>

        <h1 class="custom-font">Compelling Business Offers</h1>
        <p class="custom-p-font">When you judge someone to be ready, you need to make them a compelling offer that they can't refuse!</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">That might be to buy your product, have a chat or a meeting, or attend a webinar â€” something to help transition that prospect from a marketing funnel into a sales pipeline.</p>
        <p class="custom-p-font">Offers are the transition point between marketing and sales. Or, to use E-Myth speak, between lead generation and lead conversion. There are many creative ways to make someone an offer to engage with you, and even more boring ways! The more creative you can be the more likely your visitors are to take your offer. </p>
